## Description 
  *The what, why, and how:* 
  
  🔍 When creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a quality README. In order to be a good README, it should include information about the app such as what is the app for,how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues.  Also this README should explain detail about how, who, when to make contributions to other developers. These are more likely help developer and other users to success of the project. To create a quality README, a command-line application is important.  It will allow for quick and easy generation of a project README to get started quickly. This will allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.  The command-line application that runs with Node.js that dynamically generates a README.md file based on input about your project. 
 *Check out the [ExampleREADME.md](https://github.com/emilychhun/challenge9readme/blob/main/demo/DemoREADME.md) as an example.*

  ## Contributors
  💆🏽💆🏻‍♂️👳🏽👳🏽👳🏻‍♀️👨🏾‍🦽👨🏿‍🤝‍👨🏾As I use this for my own projects, i want to contribute to everybody such as students, my friends, and other users. I know this might not be the perfect approach for all the projects out there. If you have any ideas, just open an issue and tell me what you think. If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and make changes as you'd like. Pull requests are warmly welcome. If your vision of a perfect README.md differs greatly from mine, it might be because your projects are for vastly different. In this case, you can create anoe new file README-yourplatform.md and create the perfect boilerplate for that.
